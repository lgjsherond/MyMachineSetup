# Individual Tool Installation:

For Windows, you'll likely need to download and install each tool from their official websites:

* Brave Browser: https://brave.com/
* k6: https://loadimpact.com/
* Fiddler classic : https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddler-classic
* Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Chocolatey (Optional):

If you prefer a package manager like Homebrew on Windows, consider using Chocolatey: https://chocolatey.org/. It allows managing various software through a command-line interface. However, some tools may not be available through Chocolatey:

Install Chocolatey: https://chocolatey.org/install
